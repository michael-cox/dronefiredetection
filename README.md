# Drone-Based Fire Detection
This is a senior design project to implement *Drone-Based Fire Detection* for
ECE/COSC402 at University of Tennessee.

## What is Drone-Based Fire Detection?
With wildfires rampaging more and more in California and many other states more
and more frequently in the US, we aim to combat this surge in wildfires by
arming relatively inexpensive, environmentally friendly, easy to acquire drones
with fire detection using cameras and image processing.
